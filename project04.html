      For this project we will be creating a stand-alone web page that plays a
      game called <dfn>Lights Out</dfn>.
    </p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>
      Lights Out is played using a grid of &ldquo;lights&rdquo; that are
      either on or off.  When you click a light, the light you clicked
      on <em>and all surrounding lights</em> are each toggled between on and
      off.  Surrounding lights are defined as those immediately adjacent, as
      well as those diagonally adjacent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 1 illustrates how the toggling occurs.  On the left you can see
      the initial configuration of the game board.  Clicking on the light
      outlined in blue results in the game board on the right in which all the
      surrounding lights have been toggled.  The lights which have been
      toggled are outlined in orange.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="lightsout/transition_1.png"/>
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong>  Clicking on the square outlined
      in blue (left) results in toggling all lights outlined in orange
      (right).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Clicking on a light on the inside of the board will result in toggling a
      3&times;3 square of lights.  Note, however, that clicking on a light
      around the edge of the board will result in toggling only a 3&times;2,
      2&times;3, or 2&times;2 rectangle of lights, since they are not
      surrounded by as many lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is illustrated in Figure 2.  Again, the game board on the left
      shows the initial configuration.  Clicking in the light outlined in blue
      results in the game board on the right.  This time, however, only a
      2&times;2 square of lights have been toggled, since only those are the
      only lights surrounding the one clicked.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="lightsout/transition_2.png"/>
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong>  Clicking on a square along the
      edge (left) results in toggling a smaller area of lights (right).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The goal of the game is to get all the lights turned off.  Note that
      this may not be possible if you begin with a random configuration of
      lights.  Thus, when creating a new game you should start with all lights
      out and then &ldquo;shuffle&rdquo; the board by clicking repeatedly on
      random lights.  This method will create a game which is guaranteed to be
      solvable.
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <h4>Project</h4>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        This will not be an Express project.  All your code will run in the
        browser; you will not run a server.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should write your project as a single TypeScript file; we will not
        use modules so that we do not have to use WebPack.  Before I access
        your web page I will run your code through the TypeScript compiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        You <em>must</em> use jQuery (and only jQuery) to implement your
        project.  You may occasionally interact with the DOM directly, but in
        general you will be penalized for doing things yourself that jQuery
        could do for you.  Note that you will need the
        file <code>jquery.d.ts</code> in your project so that TypeScript will
        know the correct types for jQuery.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your HTML file should contain <em>only</em> HTML, not JavaScript or
        CSS.  That means your tags may not have event-handling attributes
        (<code>onclick</code>, <code>onsubmit</code>, etc.)
        nor <code>style</code> attributes.  They may, however,
        have <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> attributes.  <em>All</em>
        your CSS should be in a separate CSS file, and <em>all</em> your
        JavaScript should be in a separate JavaScript file (compiled from
        TypeScript).
      </li>
      <li>
        Your project should have the following layout:
        <div class="layout">
          <div>
            &#x1f4c1; <code>src</code> &mdash; TypeScript code
            <div>
              &#128196; <code>jquery.d.ts</code> &mdash; type definitions for
              jQuery
            </div>
            <div>
              &#128196; <code>lightsout.ts</code> &mdash; your code for this
              project (you can name this file whatever you like; you may have
              multiple source files)
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            &#x1f4c1; <code>www</code> &mdash; web accessible files
            <div>
              &#x1f4c1; <code>lib</code> &mdash; JavaScript code compiled from
              TypeScript (delete before submitting; I will compile)
              <div>
                &#128196; <code>lightsout.js</code> &mdash; the compiled
                TypeScript code
              </div>
              <div>
                &#128196; <code>lightsout.js.map</code> &mdash; the source map
                to your TypeScript code
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              &#128196; <code>jquery.js</code> &mdash; your jQuery
              implementation
            </div>
            <div>
              &#128196; <code>lightsout.css</code> &mdash; CSS used by your
              lights out application
            </div>
            <div>
              &#128196; <code>lightsout.html</code> &mdash; the entry point
              for your application (I will open this in a web browser)
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            &#128196; <code>tsconfig.json</code> &mdash; TypeScript project
            configuration
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="top">
          You may use this as a starter project:
        </p>
        <div>
          <a href="lightsout/starter.zip">https://cs.harding.edu/gfoust/classes/comp431/lightsout/starter.zip</a>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Game</h4>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>
        Your game should be accessed by opening <code>lightsout.html</code> in a
        web browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        Initially your page should contain only a form that allows the user to
        set the dimensions of the board.  You should use number inputs and use
        the HTML <code>min</code> / <code>max</code> attributes to keep the
        number of rows and columns each between 6 and 20.  They should
        initially be set to 8.
        <div><img src="lightsout/dimensions.png"/></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Submitting the form should not leave the page, but should instead
        create a new gameboard of the specified dimensions.  The board should
        be in a random yet solvable configuration, as described in the
        gameplay section.
        <div><img src="lightsout/gameboard.png"/></div>
        Note that submitting the form at any time should throw
        away the current game and create a new one of the dimensions
        specified in the form.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may decide what your game board looks like, but each light should
        be easy to see and to click on, and it should be clear which lights
        are on and which are off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moving the mouse over a light should change it's visual appearance
        somehow so that it is clear which light the cursor is over.  For
        example, you might change the color of its border to blue, as shown in
        Figure 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on a light should toggle it and the surrounding lights, as
        described in the gameplay section above.
      </li>
      <li>
        When clicking on a light results in all the lights being turned off
        you should display a message to tell the user he won.  You should also
        place a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> over the board so that the user
        cannot interact with it anymore.
        <div><img src="lightsout/game_over.png"/></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>All</em> of your CSS and jQuery selectors should begin with an id.
        This will ensure that your code will continue to work even if other
        elements are added to the page.  For example, do not use the
        selector <code>"td"</code> to select all the cells in your gameboard;
        this would give bad results if we later added an additional table to
        the page.  Instead, give your table an id, such as <code>board</code>,
        and then use the selector <code>"#board td"</code> to ensure you only
        select the desired table cells.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      One could certainly argue that the correct way to implement this project
      is using the MVC design pattern.  Doing so would require making a model
      for the gameboard (e.g., a two-dimensional array of booleans), writing
      code that maps the model to the DOM (e.g., creating / updating an HTML
      table to match the array), and then writing controller functions that
      update the model in response to user actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this project was intentionally designed (1) to be small and (2)
      to make heavy use of jQuery.  For that reason, I recommend that you use
      the DOM itself as your representation of the gameboard:
    </p>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>Create an HTML table for the board with a cell for each light</li>
      <li>Turn a light on by adding a CSS class to its table cell</li>
      <li>Use the jQuery <code>hasClass</code> function to test whether a
        light is on or off.  Remember that if a JQuery object holds multiple
        cells, the <code>hasClass</code> method will return true
        if <em>any</em> of the cells have the class.
      </li>
      <li>
        When creating a new board you can "shuffle" it by picking random cells
        and invoking their <code>click</code> event.
      </li>
    </ul>
